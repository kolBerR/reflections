Learning about Github does not seem to take much time. All the actions and commands appear logical and intuitive.
This is my second day of learning - i mean seriously - Git and GitHub. I feel i am absorbing the many commands and when and how to use them.
As is the case in many areas of serious study, I feel more practice will cement what I have learned so far.
